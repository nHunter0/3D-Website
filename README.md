# 3D-Website 
<br />
Just building some basic 3D website using Three.js 
<br />
**Thankyou to @codediodeio for his tutorial on youtube 
<br />

<br />
<br />
***USAGE***
<br />
git clone <this-repo>
<br />
npm install
<br />
npm run dev

Looking forward in experimenting with Three.js in the future (:
